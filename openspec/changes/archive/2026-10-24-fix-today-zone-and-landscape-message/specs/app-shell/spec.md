## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Times follow a time zone change
When the device's time zone changes, while the app is open or in the background, every screen SHALL show its times
again at once, naming a city only for times in another zone than the new device zone. What the user was doing, the
screen, its scroll position and any message on screen SHALL be kept (BRD EC-TIM-02, D36).

#### Scenario: Back from another time zone during an attack
- **WHEN** an attack was started at 14:33 in Dubai, the phone moves to Tashkent while the app is in the background,
  and the user opens the app again
- **THEN** attack mode shows "Started 2:33 PM (Dubai)" at once

#### Scenario: History open during the change
- **WHEN** History lists a Dubai attack as "Sat, Oct 24, 3:25 PM – 3:26 PM" and the phone's zone changes to Tashkent
- **THEN** the row reads "Sat, Oct 24, 3:25 PM – 3:26 PM (Dubai)" when the user looks at it again, and History stays
  on the same month
